# Noobs-Codeware

Noobs Codeware is an automated judge system that is capable to compile and execute source codes and test them with pre-constructed data within a given CPU and time limit to generate a verdict against a
particularly submitted solution for a particular problem. The system also offers any registered user to set programming contests.

<h2>Features:</h2>
● Problems with different difficulty levels.<br>
● Problem statistics for a problem showing a summary and comparison of the user submissions.<br>
● Built-in code editor to compile, run, test before submitting the source code.<br>
● Submission support for C, C++, Java, and Python.<br>
● Discussion section for every problem.<br>
● A live status page containing the submissions for all the problems.<br>
● A to-do list for adding problems to keep track and solve them later.<br>
● Global leaderboard according to the number problem solved by a user.<br>
● Dedicated development environment for compiling, executing, and testing programs.<br>
● Compilation support for C, C++, Java, Python, Php, and Javascript.<br>
● Contest participation for the contestants and monitoring option for the judges.<br>
● Ranklist for every contest according to the ICPC standard rules.<br>
● Freezing the rank list at a specific time for a contest.<br>
● Asking for clarification for any problem in contest time and judges can also answer them.<br>
● Contest participation can be restricted by allowing specific numbers of contestants(Custom contests created by users).<br>
● Monitoring statistics of other online judges(Codeforces and UVa).<br>
● Different categorized tutorials to learn and explore new.<br>
● Viewing self-profile as well as others profiles.<br>
● Social media like follow option.<br>
● Basic blog features.<br>
● CRUD operation for every added content.<br>
● Live searching for filter-out contests, problems, tutorials, and submissions.<br>
● Announcing new updates.<br>

<h2>Judge Verdicts:</h2>
● In Queue: The submission is not processed yet.<br>
● Compilation Error: The submitted solution has not been successfully compiled. Generally this kind of error occurs due to syntax error or straightforward division by zero error.<br>
● Runtime Error: The submitted solution is successfully compiled but the error occurs during the execution. This kind of error occurs when missing array index, division by zero at the execution, segmentation-fault, or floating-point exception, etc.<br>
● Time Limit Exceeded: The solution is compiled but taking more time than the actual limit during the execution.<br>
● Memory Limit Exceeded: The solution is compiled but demanding more memory than the actual limit during the execution.<br>
● Wrong Answer: The solution is compiled and executed successfully but the generated output is not matching with the judge outputs.<br>
● Accepted: The solution has passed all the test cases successfully.<br>
